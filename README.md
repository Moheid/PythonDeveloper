## Python Developer
Python is a very popular general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL).
This tutorial gives a complete understanding of Python programming language starting from basic conceopts to advanced concepts. This tutorial will take you through simple and practical approaches while learning Python Programming language.

## Why to Learn Python?
Python is consistently rated as one of the world's most popular programming languages. Python is fairly easy to learn, so if you are starting to learn any programming language then Python could be your great choice. Today various Schools, Colleges and Universities are teaching Python as their primary programming language. There are many other good reasons which makes Python as the top choice of any programmer:

- Python is Open Source which means its available free of cost.
- Python is simple and so easy to learn
- Python is versatile and can be used to create many different things.
- Python has powerful development libraries include AI, ML etc.
- Python is much in demand and ensures high salary

**Python** is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Python:

- **Python is Interpreted** − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.
- **Python is Interactive** − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.
- **Python is Object-Oriented** − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.
- **Python is a Beginner's Language** − Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.

## Pythonic Code Style
Python leaves you free to choose to program in an object-oriented, procedural, functional, aspect-oriented, or even logic-oriented way. These freedoms make Python a great language to write clean and beautiful code.

Pythonic Code Style is actually more of a design philosophy and suggests to write a code which is :

- Clean
- Simple
- Beautiful
- Explicit
- Readable
  
## Python Local Variables

Python Local Variables are defined inside a function. We can not access variable outside the function.
***A Python functions is a piece of reusable code and you will learn more about function in Python - Functions tutorial.***

### Example
Following is an example to show the usage of local variables:

`def sum(x,y):
   sum = x + y
   return sum
print(sum(5, 10))`

## Python Global Variables

Any variable created outside a function can be accessed within any function and so they have global scope.

### Example

Following is an example of global variables −
`x = 5
y = 10
def sum():
   sum = x + y
   return sum
print(sum())`

## Constants in Python

Python doesn't have any formally defined constants, However you can indicate a variable to be treated as a constant by using all-caps names with underscores. For example, the name PI_VALUE indicates that you don't want the variable redefined or changed in any way.

***The naming convention using all-caps is sometimes referred to as screaming snake case - where the all-caps (screaming) and the underscores (snakes).***
